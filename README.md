## Battery Indicator:

A script that lets you know when your computer drains to 20% and charges to 80% to prolong battery health.

Options such as thresholds, sound and message box indicatiors can be changed in the config.ini file.

Required python packages:
psutil
winsound

Currently this script only works on windows (due to the use of winsound)
